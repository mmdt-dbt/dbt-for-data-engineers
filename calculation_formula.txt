Hazard = 0.50 * Magnitude_Score + 0.30 * Depth_Score+ 0.20 * Frequency_Score
Hazard scaling:
Magnitude_Score = normalize(magnitude, 0–10)
Depth_Score = 1 - normalize(depth_km, 0–700)(shallower earthquakes = higher hazard)
Frequency_Score = normalize(earthquakes_per_township)

Exposure  = 0.60 * Population_Score + 0.40 * Infrastructure_Score
Exposure scaling:
Population_Score = normalize(population per township)
Infrastructure_Score = normalize(count of infra_id per township)

Vulnerability = 0.60 * PopDensity_Score + 0.40 * InfraDensity_Score 
Vulnerability scaling:
PopDensity_Score = normalize(population / township_area)
InfraDensity_Score = normalize(infrastructure_count / township_area)

Earthquake Risk Index(ERI):
ERI = 0.40 * Hazard + 0.40 * Exposure + 0.20 * Vulnerability
Normalize ERI into 0–100 scale:
ERI_Score = normalize(ERI) * 100

ERI Score per township
ERI Score	Risk Level	Description
80–100		Extreme		High population + critical infrastructure + strong earthquakes
60–80		High		Densely populated or many infrastructures
40–60		Moderate	Some activity, medium exposure
20–40		Low		Low population or low earthquake frequency
0–20		Minimal		No recent significant earthquakes
